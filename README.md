This tool will create a map config line for your Alien Arena server based on the maps in the current directory. It sends the output to standard-out so you should redirect to a file or copy & paste it to your config file manually.

Usage like this:

        makemap <game type> [<debug>]

"game type" should be dm or ctf. If you want to get debugging info add "debug" as the next argument. Do it like this:

        makemap ctf debug
